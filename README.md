# Fine-Grained-Sentiment-Analysis-of-Amazon-Review-
Our sentiment analysis project for Amazon product reviews using NLP techniques in Python has yielded valuable insights into customer sentiments. By collecting, preprocessing, and analyzing a diverse dataset, we successfully trained and evaluated a sentiment analysis model. The model's interpretability helped us understand key drivers of sentiment classification. Additionally, the optional deployment feature enhances Amazon's customer feedback analysis capabilities. This project underscores the importance of NLP in extracting actionable insights from unstructured text data and offers a valuable resource for decision-making and product improvement at Amazon.
